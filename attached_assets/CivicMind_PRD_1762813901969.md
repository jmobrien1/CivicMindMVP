# CivicMind Product Requirements Document (PRD)

**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** November 2025  
**Status:** Draft for Pilot Phase  
**Product:** CivicMind - AI for Every Municipality

---

## Executive Summary

CivicMind is a turnkey AI platform and managed service that enables small and mid-sized municipalities (under 150K population) to deploy vetted, compliant AI assistants safely and quickly without requiring data scientists or custom development. The platform addresses a critical gap: 95% of US municipalities under 150K population lack any structured approach to deploy or govern AI systems despite growing pressure to modernize public services.

**Product Vision:** Become the trusted public-sector AI fabric — a shared, transparent layer through which every town can deploy intelligent assistants safely.

**Initial Target Market:** New England and Mid-Atlantic municipalities representing ~$200M annual TAM at $1-3K/month/assistant pricing.

---

## Problem Statement

### Current State
Small and mid-sized US municipalities face mounting pressure to modernize public services and improve citizen engagement, yet nearly all lack secure, affordable, and trustworthy paths to AI adoption.

### Key Pain Points

**1. Limited Technical Capacity**
- Most towns have tiny IT teams (1-3 people) focused on maintenance, not innovation
- No in-house expertise in AI/ML, data science, or modern cloud architectures
- Staff already overwhelmed with legacy system support

**2. Security and Privacy Risks**
- Public data includes PII, education records (FERPA), and health information (HIPAA)
- Subject to state and federal privacy laws with severe penalties for violations
- No frameworks for responsible AI governance or bias mitigation

**3. Vendor Fragmentation**
- Departments independently purchase isolated chatbots or workflow tools
- Solutions don't integrate with existing systems
- Lack of municipality-wide governance or compliance oversight
- High per-solution costs with poor ROI

**4. Public Trust Challenges**
- Fear of AI bias, misinformation, or "rogue AI" prevents experimentation
- Citizens demand transparency in government AI use
- No clear audit trails or accountability mechanisms

### Impact
Without CivicMind, 95% of US municipalities under 150K population remain unable to:
- Respond to citizen inquiries 24/7
- Provide multilingual services at scale
- Automate routine administrative tasks
- Make budget documents and policies accessible to average citizens
- Compete for talent against municipalities offering modern digital services

## Conclusion

CivicMind addresses a critical and urgent need: enabling small and mid-sized municipalities to safely adopt AI and modernize government services. By providing a turnkey platform with built-in governance, transparency, and compliance, CivicMind removes the barriers that have prevented 95% of US municipalities from adopting AI.

The pilot phase will prove the technical approach and value proposition with 3 Massachusetts towns. Success in the pilot will unlock regional expansion across New England and position CivicMind for national scaling in Year 2.

This PRD defines the product requirements, architecture, and roadmap to achieve the vision of CivicMind becoming the trusted AI fabric for local government — democratizing AI benefits beyond big cities to every town.
